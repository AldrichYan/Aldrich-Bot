		this.say(room, `!code "mish is the greatest four-letter word ever to be birthed by humankind. Properly understood, mish can provide deep meaning and insight to any honest inquirer, and saying mish can elicit joy, courage, and most importantly, a fuller appreciation of life itself.

Many lack an understanding of mish, which is understandable to those who have not yet reached enlightenment. Although fully grasping mish is difficult, we may look to the example of others to help us on our quest. Take the fine user Demantoid as an example:

trello: Guys I made a tinder I’m scared
trello: What do I say
Demantoid: mish

In this log, we see Demantoid offer a small piece of his wisdom. Inquiry about what to say on Tinder was met simply with those beautiful 4 letters: mish. Such a simple word reveals a complex truth: mish can properly be used in almost any situation imaginable. Some may say respond to this point with foolish thoughts such as these: "It is inappropriate to say mish in every situation.". Such ignorance still remains even in the hearts of top Doubles OU players, and those who understanding the fuller meaning of mish consider these poor lost souls with deep pity.

Secondly, mish transcends many conventions of grammar. "mish" properly understood is a state of affairs quantified by the state of having mish attached to it. This necessarily affords great flexibility in its use. For example, should I be haxed in a prestigious game of the Doubles Premier League, it is both appropriate to respond "mish" and that the object of the hax (I, myself) was "mished". You may adopt a sort of noun usage (e.g. that was "a mish" or "fini = mish" or comparable examples), but such usage is less common than simply uttering mish." - DaWoblefet,2019, full definition at https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/in-this-thread-we-predict-against-croven-dpl-5-meme-thread.3648350/page-3#post-8102738
